# LCC Assemble Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Community-First Development
Every feature must serve the LCC community's real needs and strengthen connections; User feedback drives all development decisions; Features must be intuitive for non-technical community members; Community engagement metrics validate feature success over technical metrics.

### II. Zero-Cost Sustainability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All infrastructure and tools must remain free indefinitely; Firebase free tier limits are hard constraints; No premium APIs, paid services, or subscription dependencies; Open source technologies only; Cost monitoring and optimization mandatory.

### III. Mobile-Responsive Design
Every interface works seamlessly on mobile devices first; Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop; Touch-friendly interactions with appropriate sizing; Offline functionality where feasible; Fast loading on slower connections (<3s on 3G).

### IV. Privacy by Design
Member data visibility controlled by user preferences; Minimal data collection - only what serves community needs; No external tracking or analytics beyond Firebase; WhatsApp/contact sharing requires explicit consent; Admin access logged and auditable.

### V. Test-Driven Quality
Core user flows must have comprehensive tests before deployment; Authentication, RSVP, and event creation are critical paths requiring 90%+ test coverage; Real community beta testing required before major releases; Performance testing mandatory for all releases.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **Backend**: Firebase services only (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Hosting)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for comprehensive coverage
- **Mobile**: React Native for cross-platform development (Phase 2)

### Performance Standards
- Page load time <3 seconds on 3G connection
- Time to interactive <5 seconds
- Bundle size <500KB initial load
- 99%+ uptime reliability
- Responsive design across all device sizes

### Security Requirements
- All data transmission over HTTPS
- Firebase Auth security rules properly configured
- Input validation and sanitization on all forms
- XSS and CSRF protection implemented
- Regular dependency security audits

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Community Need Identification**: Feature request from community feedback or admin observation
2. **Specification**: Clear user stories and acceptance criteria defined
3. **Design**: UI/UX mockups created following design system
4. **Test Planning**: Test cases written covering happy path and edge cases
5. **Implementation**: Code written following TypeScript and React best practices
6. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing completed
7. **Community Review**: Beta testing with select community members
8. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring and rollback capability

### Code Quality Gates
- TypeScript strict mode enforced - no `any` types allowed
- ESLint and Prettier compliance required
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new features
- All authentication and data security tests must pass
- Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness validated on real devices

### Release Management
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Database migration scripts for schema changes
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- User communication plan for breaking changes

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and decisions. All pull requests must demonstrate compliance with these principles. Feature complexity must be justified against community benefit. Any amendments require:

1. **Documentation**: Clear rationale and impact analysis
2. **Community Input**: Feedback from active community members
3. **Admin Approval**: Consensus among project administrators
4. **Migration Plan**: Clear steps for implementing changes

Breaking these principles requires exceptional justification and explicit approval from the project owner. The constitution evolves with the community but maintains core values of simplicity, privacy, and community focus.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-01-15 | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-15
