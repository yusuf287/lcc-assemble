# Feature Specification: Registration Flow Bug Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `003-bug-fixes`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Completed
**Input**: User reports of registration flow issues

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Privacy Step Button Logic
**Problem**: "Join the Community" button is disabled if user didn't check any box, but gets activated if user selects and deselects.

**Root Cause**: Button is disabled when `!privacyStepInteracted` is true. `privacyStepInteracted` is only set to true when checkbox onChange events fire. If user never touches checkboxes, button stays disabled.

**Expected Behavior**: Button should be enabled when user has made a conscious choice about privacy settings (either accepting or explicitly declining visibility options).

### Issue 2: Address Validation Inconsistency
**Problem**: Address says "optional" in UI but registration fails without address information.

**Root Cause**: Validation logic checks if any address field is filled, then makes ALL address fields required. This creates confusing UX where "optional" fields become mandatory.

**Expected Behavior**: Address should be truly optional, or UI should clearly indicate when fields become required.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user reaches the privacy settings step, **When** they review the privacy options without checking any boxes, **Then** the "Join the Community" button should be enabled (indicating they accept default private settings).
2. **Given** a user reaches the privacy settings step, **When** they check/uncheck privacy options, **Then** the "Join the Community" button should remain enabled.
3. **Given** a user is filling address information, **When** they leave some address fields blank, **Then** all address fields should be required and validated.
4. **Given** a user wants to provide address information, **When** they fill in address fields, **Then** all three fields (street, city, postal code) must be completed.
5. **Given** a user reaches the interests step, **When** they try to proceed, **Then** they must select at least 1 interest from the available options.
6. **Given** a user reaches the dietary preferences step, **When** they try to proceed, **Then** they must select at least 1 dietary preference.
7. **Given** a user is filling profile information, **When** they leave the WhatsApp number field blank, **Then** the form should require a valid WhatsApp number.
8. **Given** a user clicks "Next" to progress through steps, **When** they reach the final step, **Then** they must explicitly click "Join the Community" to complete registration.
9. **Given** a user completes registration, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they should be signed out and redirected to email verification (not logged in automatically).
10. **Given** a user goes back from the email verification page, **When** they try to access protected routes, **Then** they should be redirected to login since they haven't verified their email.

### Edge Cases
- User rapidly clicks privacy checkboxes - button should remain enabled
- User fills one address field then clears it - should not trigger validation
- User uses browser back/forward during registration - state should be preserved correctly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable "Join the Community" button when user reaches privacy step, regardless of checkbox interactions
- **FR-002**: System MUST make address fields truly optional without conditional validation requirements
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback about form completion status
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle rapid user interactions without breaking button state

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Form validation should be immediate and clear
- **NFR-002**: Button states should be predictable and consistent
- **NFR-003**: User experience should be intuitive and frustration-free

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Privacy Button Fix
1. Modify `privacyStepInteracted` logic to default to true
2. Remove dependency on checkbox onChange events for button enablement
3. Add visual indicator that user has reviewed privacy settings

### Phase 2: Address Validation Fix
1. Update validation schema to make address fields independently optional
2. Remove conditional validation logic in RegistrationPage
3. Update UI labels to be consistent with actual validation rules

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. Test complete registration flow with various user interactions
2. Verify button states work correctly in all scenarios
3. Ensure address validation works as expected
