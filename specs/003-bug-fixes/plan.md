# Implementation Plan: Registration Flow Bug Fixes

**Branch**: `003-bug-fixes` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: specs/003-bug-fixes/spec.md
**Input**: User reports of registration flow issues

## Summary
This plan addresses critical bugs in the user registration flow that prevent successful account creation. The issues involve confusing button states and inconsistent validation logic that create a frustrating user experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React Hook Form, Zod validation
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers with form validation
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing user data structure and Firebase integration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before implementation*

**User Experience First**:
- Registration flow must be intuitive and frustration-free
- Form validation should be clear and immediate
- Button states should be predictable and consistent

**Quality Assurance**:
- All form interactions must work reliably
- Validation logic must be consistent with UI labels
- Edge cases must be properly handled

## Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Privacy Step Button Logic
**Current Problem**: Button disabled when `!privacyStepInteracted`, only enabled when checkboxes change
**Solution**: Enable button by default, add visual confirmation user has reviewed settings

### Issue 2: Address Validation Logic
**Current Problem**: Address marked "optional" but becomes required if any field filled
**Solution**: Make address mandatory with all fields required for complete user profiles

### Issue 3: Interest Selection Requirements
**Current Problem**: Interests completely optional, leading to empty user profiles
**Solution**: Require at least 1 interest selection for better community matching

### Issue 4: Dietary Preferences Requirements
**Current Problem**: Dietary preferences completely optional
**Solution**: Require at least 1 dietary preference for event planning

### Issue 5: WhatsApp Number Requirements
**Current Problem**: WhatsApp number optional despite being core communication method
**Solution**: Make WhatsApp number mandatory for community coordination

### Issue 6: Auto-Submission Prevention
**Current Problem**: Form validation timing causes unintended auto-advancement
**Solution**: Change form validation mode and ensure explicit user actions only

### Issue 7: Registration Redirect Flow
**Current Problem**: User logged in after registration, redirected to dashboard instead of email verification
**Solution**: Sign out user immediately after registration to require email verification before login

## Phase 1: Privacy Button Fix
*Prerequisites: spec.md complete*

1. **Update RegistrationPage state logic**:
   - Change `privacyStepInteracted` default to `true`
   - Remove onChange dependency for button enablement
   - Add visual indicator for privacy review completion

2. **Update button enablement logic**:
   - Button enabled when user reaches step 4
   - Maintain form validation requirements
   - Add loading states for better UX

## Phase 2: Mandatory Field Requirements
*Prerequisites: Phase 1 complete*

1. **Update validation schema**:
    - Make address mandatory with all fields required
    - Make WhatsApp number mandatory
    - Make at least 1 interest selection mandatory
    - Make at least 1 dietary preference mandatory

2. **Update RegistrationPage validation**:
    - Add validation for all mandatory fields
    - Update step progression logic
    - Update UI labels to indicate required fields
    - Test all validation scenarios

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation
*Prerequisites: Phase 2 complete*

1. **Manual testing scenarios**:
    - Complete registration with all mandatory fields filled
    - Verify address fields are all required
    - Verify WhatsApp number is required
    - Verify at least 1 interest is required
    - Verify at least 1 dietary preference is required
    - Test privacy checkbox interactions
    - Verify "Next" button doesn't auto-submit form
    - Confirm explicit "Join the Community" button click required
    - Test registration redirect to email verification (not dashboard)
    - Test back navigation from email verification page

2. **Integration testing**:
    - Verify Firebase user creation works
    - Test email verification flow
    - Validate data persistence
    - Test user sign-out after registration
