# Research Findings: Add Delete Option for Events

## Decision: Soft Delete (Cancel) Events

**Rationale**: Based on community-first principles and data integrity requirements, events should be soft-deleted by marking them as "cancelled" rather than hard-deleted from the database. This preserves event history, RSVPs, and maintains transparency for the community.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hard delete: Would remove all event data permanently
- Rejected because: Loses community history and RSVP records, violates data integrity principles

## Decision: Organizer-Only Deletion Permission

**Rationale**: Only event organizers should be able to delete/cancel their own events. This maintains accountability and prevents unauthorized cancellations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Admin-only deletion: Would centralize control but reduce organizer autonomy
- Any member deletion: Would create chaos and lack accountability
- Rejected because: Current edit permissions already restrict to organizers only

## Decision: Preserve RSVPs on Cancellation

**Rationale**: When an event is cancelled, all RSVP data should be preserved. This maintains records of who intended to attend and provides transparency about the cancellation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Clear all RSVPs: Would erase attendance intentions
- Rejected because: Violates community transparency and record-keeping needs

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Current System Analysis
- **Event Status Types**: `'draft' | 'published' | 'cancelled' | 'completed'` (cancelled status already exists)
- **Existing Functions**:
  - `cancelEvent()`: Sets status to 'cancelled' (soft cancel)
  - `deleteEvent()`: Hard deletes document and associated images
- **Permission Model**: Edit access restricted to event organizer only
- **UI Context**: Delete option should be added to EditEventPage interface

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Placement**: Delete button should be prominently placed but separated from save actions
- **Confirmation**: Multi-step confirmation dialog required (similar to destructive actions)
- **Feedback**: Clear success/error messaging
- **Navigation**: Redirect to events list after successful deletion

### Data Flow
1. User clicks delete button in event edit interface
2. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to cancel this event?"
3. Secondary confirmation: "This will notify all attendees. Continue?"
4. Call `cancelEvent(eventId)` service function
5. Update event status to 'cancelled'
6. Redirect to events list with success message

### Error Handling
- Network failures: Retry mechanism or offline queue
- Permission errors: Clear messaging about authorization
- Concurrent modifications: Handle with optimistic updates

### Testing Strategy
- **Contract Tests**: Verify cancelEvent API behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Test full delete flow from UI to database
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user journey including confirmations
- **Edge Cases**: Test with events that have RSVPs, waitlists, bring lists

## Constitution Compliance

**✅ Community-First**: Preserves event history and RSVP transparency
**✅ Zero-Cost**: Uses existing Firebase infrastructure
**✅ Mobile-Responsive**: Follows existing UI patterns
**✅ Privacy by Design**: Maintains existing privacy controls
**✅ Test-Driven**: Will follow TDD with comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Dependencies

- **Existing Code**: Leverage `cancelEvent()` function (already implemented)
- **UI Components**: Use existing Button, Card, confirmation patterns
- **Navigation**: Use existing React Router patterns
- **Error Handling**: Use existing toast notification system

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Uses existing infrastructure and patterns
**Migration**: No database schema changes required
**Backwards Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing events
**Performance**: Minimal impact (single document update)

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: Delete button appears for organizers, successfully cancels events
- **User Experience**: Clear confirmation flow, appropriate feedback
- **Data Integrity**: All RSVP and event data preserved
- **Community Impact**: Transparent cancellation process maintained
