# Feature Specification: Add Delete Option for Events

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-delete-option`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "wants to add a delete option when editing events, allowing cancellation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description: "wants to add a delete option when editing events, allowing cancellation."
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Event creators/organizers
   ‚Üí Actions: Delete/cancel events
   ‚Üí Context: During event editing
   ‚Üí Data: Events
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Who can delete events? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Only event creators, or admins too?]
   ‚Üí What happens to RSVPs when event is deleted? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Cancel RSVPs automatically?]
   ‚Üí Is this a soft delete or hard delete? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Remove from system or mark as cancelled?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Events entity involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items found: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an event organizer, I want to be able to delete events that I no longer want to host, so that I can cancel events that are no longer happening or were created by mistake.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am editing an event I created, **When** I click the delete option, **Then** I should see a confirmation dialog asking if I want to delete the event
2. **Given** I confirm the deletion, **When** the event is deleted, **Then** I should be redirected to the events list and see a success message
3. **Given** I am viewing an event that has been deleted, **When** other users try to access it, **Then** they should see an appropriate "event not found" or "event cancelled" message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to delete an event that already has RSVPs?
- How does the system handle deletion of recurring events?
- What if multiple users try to delete the same event simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a delete option in the event editing interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a confirmation dialog before deleting an event
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent deletion of events by users who are not the event creator [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: permission model not specified]
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle RSVPs appropriately when an event is deleted [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide appropriate feedback to users after event deletion
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent access to deleted events by other users

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents a scheduled gathering with attributes like title, date, location, and creator
- **RSVP**: Represents a user's response to an event invitation, linked to both users and events
