# Implementation Plan: Add Delete Option for Events

**Branch**: `002-add-delete-option` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-add-delete-option/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Add a delete option to the event editing interface that allows event organizers to cancel/delete events they created. The feature will include confirmation dialogs, proper permission checks, and appropriate handling of related data like RSVPs. Technical approach will use Firebase Firestore for data operations with React/TypeScript frontend components.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2.2, React 18.2.0
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase 10.7.1, React Router DOM 6.30.1, React Hook Form 7.48.2, Zod 3.25.76, Tailwind CSS 3.3.6
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL document database)
**Testing**: Jest 29.7.0, React Testing Library 14.1.2, Cypress 15.2.0
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + Firebase backend)
**Performance Goals**: <3s page load time, <500KB initial bundle, 99%+ uptime
**Constraints**: Mobile-responsive design, Firebase free tier limits, HTTPS only, <200ms API response times
**Scale/Scope**: Community app for ~100-1000 active users, event management with RSVPs and bring lists

## Constitution Check

- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (Firebase, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes for contract changes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (Firebase logging)
- Frontend logs → backend? Yes (Firebase unified logging)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (will include user context, error details)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes (1.0.0)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes (semantic versioning)
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (migration plan if needed)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend + Firebase backend detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh kilocode` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract (cancel-event-api.json) → contract test task [P]
- Each user story from quickstart.md → integration test task
- UI component tasks for delete button and confirmation dialogs
- Service integration tasks for cancelEvent function
- Error handling and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Service functions → UI components → Error handling
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent test files)
- Sequential for UI flow (delete button → confirmation → API call → redirect)

**Expected Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Tests** (3-4 tasks): Test cancelEvent API contract
2. **Integration Tests** (4-5 tasks): Test full user flows from quickstart
3. **UI Components** (3-4 tasks): Delete button, confirmation dialogs
4. **Service Integration** (2-3 tasks): API calls and error handling
5. **Validation** (2-3 tasks): Permission checks, data integrity

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
