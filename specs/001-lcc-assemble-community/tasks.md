# Tasks: LCC Assemble

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-lcc-assemble-community/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify all tests fail before implementing any functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- Use exact file paths as specified
- Avoid modifying the same file in parallel tasks
- Follow TDD: Red (failing tests) → Green (implementation) → Refactor

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - firestore.rules → T006 contract test [P]
   - storage.rules → T007 contract test [P]
   - firebase-config.json → T008 contract test [P]

2. **From Data Model**:
   - User entity → T015 types [P], T021 service [P]
   - Event entity → T016 types [P], T022 service [P]
   - Notification entity → T017 types [P], T023 service [P]
   - BringItem entity → T018 types [P]

3. **From User Stories**:
   - User registration → T009 integration test [P]
   - Event creation → T010 integration test [P]
   - RSVP system → T011 integration test [P]
   - Member directory → T012 integration test [P]
   - Bring list → T013 integration test [P]
   - Admin approval → T014 integration test [P]

4. **From User Stories** (continued):
    - Community information page → T043 Info page [P]

5. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
    - End-to-end user journey → T071 e2e testing
