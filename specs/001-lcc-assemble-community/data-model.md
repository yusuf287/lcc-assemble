# Data Model: LCC Assemble

## Data Flow Patterns

### User Registration Flow
1. User submits registration form
2. Account created with 'pending' status
3. Admin approval changes to 'approved'
4. User can complete profile setup
5. Profile data stored in User collection

### Event Creation Flow
1. Organizer creates event with details
2. Event stored with 'draft' status
3. Organizer publishes event
4. Notifications sent to community members
5. Attendees can RSVP and claim bring items

### RSVP and Attendance Flow
1. User views event details
2. User submits RSVP with status and guest count
3. Attendance data stored in event's attendees map
4. If capacity reached, user added to waitlist
5. Notifications sent for status changes

## Security Considerations

### Access Patterns
- Users can read/write their own profile data
- All authenticated users can read public events
- Event organizers can modify their events
- Admins can read all data and modify member status
- Privacy settings control visibility of contact information

### Data Validation
- All user inputs validated on client and server
- File uploads restricted to images with size limits
- Rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexing Strategy
- Compound indexes on frequently queried fields
- Event queries by date, type, and organizer
- User queries by status and role
- Notification queries by recipient and read status

### Caching Strategy
- Firebase CDN for static assets
- Browser caching for images and data
- Real-time listeners for dynamic content
- Offline support for critical features

### Query Optimization
- Pagination for large result sets
- Selective field retrieval
- Batch operations for bulk updates
- Efficient subcollection queries
