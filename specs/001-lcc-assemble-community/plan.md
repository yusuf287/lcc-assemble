# Implementation Plan: LCC Assemble

**Branch**: `001-lcc-assemble-community` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Last Updated**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: specs/001-lcc-assemble-community/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-lcc-assemble-community/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application with React frontend and Firebase backend services

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Firebase Firestore best practices for community apps
   - React patterns for real-time data synchronization
   - Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Privacy-focused user data management
   - Test strategies for Firebase-dependent applications

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Firebase Firestore security rules for community event management"
   Task: "Find best practices for React + Firebase authentication flows"
   Task: "Research mobile-responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS"
   Task: "Find privacy-preserving data patterns for user directories"
   Task: "Research testing strategies for real-time Firebase applications"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Firebase Firestore with granular security rules
   - Rationale: Provides real-time sync, scales well, free tier sufficient
   - Alternatives considered: MongoDB Atlas (paid), Supabase (limits), local SQLite (no sync)
   
   - Decision: React Context + Firebase Auth for state management
   - Rationale: Simple, integrated with Firebase, sufficient for app scope
   - Alternatives considered: Redux (overkill), Zustand (similar complexity)

**Output**: research.md with all research findings documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User: uid, email, displayName, phone, whatsapp, bio, interests, dietaryPreferences, profileImage, address, privacy settings, role, status
   - Event: id, title, description, type, visibility, organizer, dateTime, duration, location, capacity, coverImage, images, bringList, attendees, waitlist, status
   - Notification: id, recipientId, type, title, message, eventId, read, createdAt
   - BringItem: id, item, quantity, assignedTo, fulfilled
   - Validation rules: Email format, required fields, privacy constraints
   - State transitions: Event draft→published→completed, User pending→approved→suspended

2. **Generate Firebase contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Firestore security rules for read/write access based on user roles and privacy settings
   - Storage security rules for image uploads
   - Auth configuration for email/password authentication
   - Output security rules and configuration to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Firestore security rule tests for each collection
   - Auth flow tests for registration and login
   - Storage upload tests for images
   - Tests must fail initially (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - User registration and profile setup → integration test
   - Event creation and RSVP → integration test  
   - Bring list management → integration test
   - Member directory search → integration test
   - Admin member approval → integration test
   - Quickstart test = end-to-end user journey from registration to event participation

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh kilocode` for your AI assistant
   - Add Firebase integration patterns, React + TypeScript best practices
   - Preserve existing context, update recent changes
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root as `.kilocode-context.md`

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/* (security rules, auth config), failing contract tests, quickstart.md, .kilocode-context.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- Each Firestore collection → data model and service task [P]
- Each security rule → contract test task [P]
- Each user story → integration test scenario
- Each UI component → implementation task with test
- Firebase configuration → setup task
- Authentication flows → implementation tasks
- Admin features → separate tasks with role checks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Firebase setup → Auth → Data models → Services → UI components
- Parallel execution: Independent components (models, tests, UI components)
- Sequential: Auth-dependent features, admin features

**Estimated Output**: 50-55 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Firebase project setup and configuration
- Authentication system implementation (including password reset)
- Data models and Firestore integration
- Core user flows (registration, profile, events, RSVP)
- Admin dashboard and member management
- Public information page about the community
- Member directory with individual profile viewing
- Private event creation with member invitations
- Map integration for event locations
- Event editing functionality
- Enhanced date/time validation
- Password reset functionality
- UI components and responsive design
- Testing and validation
- Deployment and monitoring

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
