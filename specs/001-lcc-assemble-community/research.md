# Research Findings: LCC Assemble

## Firebase Firestore Security Rules for Community Event Management

**Decision**: Implement granular security rules with role-based access control
- Users can read/write their own profiles
- All authenticated users can read public event data
- Event organizers can modify their events
- Admins have elevated permissions for member management
- Privacy settings control contact information visibility

**Rationale**: 
- Ensures data privacy and security
- Supports community features while protecting sensitive information
- Aligns with Firebase free tier limitations
- Provides audit trail for admin actions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Client-side validation only (insufficient security)
- Simple read/write permissions (too permissive)
- Complex role hierarchies (over-engineering for community scale)

## React + Firebase Authentication Patterns

**Decision**: Use Firebase Auth with React Context for state management
- Email/password authentication with password reset
- Automatic token refresh and session management
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- User profile integration with Firestore

**Rationale**:
- Seamless integration with Firebase ecosystem
- Handles authentication edge cases automatically
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Supports the required user flows

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation (complex, error-prone)
- Third-party auth providers (may incur costs)
- Redux for auth state (unnecessary complexity)

## Mobile-Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind utility classes
- Base styles for mobile, progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Consistent spacing and color system
- Component-based styling with custom utilities
- Dark mode support for better accessibility

**Rationale**:
- Ensures excellent mobile experience
- Fast development with utility-first CSS
- Consistent design system
- Good performance with purging unused styles

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Desktop-first responsive design (poor mobile experience)
- CSS modules (slower development)
- Styled components (runtime overhead)

## Privacy-Preserving User Data Patterns

**Decision**: User-controlled privacy settings with minimal data collection
- Granular privacy controls for each data field
- Data minimization - collect only what's needed
- Transparent data usage policies
- Easy data export/deletion options

**Rationale**:
- Builds user trust and complies with privacy regulations
- Aligns with constitution's privacy by design principle
- Reduces data management complexity
- Supports community-focused features

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No privacy controls (violates constitution)
- Complex consent management (over-engineering)
- External privacy platforms (adds cost and complexity)

## Testing Strategies for Real-Time Firebase Applications

**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library with Firebase emulator
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for Firebase operations
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Firebase emulator for local testing

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- Tests real Firebase interactions without external dependencies
- Supports TDD workflow
- Catches integration issues early

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual testing only (insufficient for reliability)
- Mock Firebase SDK (misses real integration issues)
- Cypress for all tests (slower, more complex setup)
