# Feature Specification: LCC Assemble

**Feature Branch**: `001-lcc-assemble-community`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive specification for LCC Assemble, a community event management platform for organizing potlucks, birthdays, and other gatherings with features like RSVP, bring lists, member directory, admin controls, and an informational page about the Lakeshore Cultural Committee community."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a member of the LCC community, I want to easily organize and participate in events like potlucks, birthdays, and celebrations, so that I can build stronger connections with fellow members through shared activities and meals.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is registered and logged in, **When** they create a new event with details like title, date, location, and type, **Then** the event is saved, published to the community, and visible in the events list.
2. **Given** an event is published, **When** a member RSVPs as going with a guest count, **Then** their attendance is recorded, the event's attendee count is updated, and they receive a confirmation notification.
3. **Given** an event has an enabled bring list with items, **When** a member claims an available item, **Then** the item is assigned to them, marked as fulfilled, and other members cannot claim it.
4. **Given** a visitor accesses the Info page, **When** they view the community information, **Then** they can see details about the Lakeshore Cultural Committee, what activities they organize, and how to get involved.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when event capacity is reached? The system adds the user to a waitlist and notifies them of their position.
- How does the system handle duplicate RSVPs from the same user? The system updates the existing RSVP with the latest response and prevents multiple entries.
- What happens if an event organizer cancels an event? The system notifies all attendees via email and in-app notifications, updates the event status to cancelled, and removes it from active listings.
- How does the system manage conflicts in bring list claims? If two users claim the same item simultaneously, the system assigns it to the first claimant and notifies the second user that the item is no longer available.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
